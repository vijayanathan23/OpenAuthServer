Client-Side Third-Party Login: Users initiate login on the client, selecting from various third-party providers.
Server Validation: The client sends the third-party token to the backend, where the server validates it.
JWT Token Generation: Upon successful validation, the server generates a secure JWT token for the user, embedding user data and permissions.
Scalable and Configurable: The backend is modular, allowing future integrations with new providers as they emerge. A Dockerized setup enables easy deployment.
Reusable for Startups: The library will have a simple API, detailed documentation, and configurable options, making it ideal for early-stage startups needing efficient, secure authentication.
